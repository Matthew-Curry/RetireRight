# RetireRight
RetireRight is a personal finance SPA intended to help users think holistically about the lifestyle they want to live and the role money plays within it.
Rather than focusing on abstract concepts like "risk tolarance" or solely on investment numbers, the app allows users to define different "scenarios" 
holding different lifestyle choice variables. A scenario includes information such as cost of housing, money spent on yearly travel, how many and what
age to have children, etc. Then, in addition to investment choice information, the application runs a Monte Carlo simulation and displays to users the 
percent chance they will have enough money to fund their retirement, along with a graph of the best, worst, and average result of the simulation.
