    <p align="left">
      RetireRight is a personal finance application designed to help people
      develop a financial plan, and more critically to think about the role
      money has in their lives. The inspiration for the project came from the
      fact that most free investment planning tools simply accept a rate and a
      timeline to graph investment growth projections without accounting for the
      context of a person's lifestyle.

      RetireRight accepts base user information and invesment allocation
      decisions, which can be reconfigured on the main page. It then accepts a
      set of lifestyle choice variables in the form of a "scenario". A user can
      add as many scenarios to their account as they like. When updating a
      scenario, a Monte Carlo simulation will be run for the user and scenario
      information, and a percent chance of success, defined as the probability
      the user will have enough money to spend at their estimated retirement
      expenditures through a 30 year retirment, will be shown on the top of the
      scenario.

      On the main page, the user can select a scenario to see the worst,
      average, and best possible outcomes for their invesment based on the
      simualation.
